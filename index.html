    <p>They honeybee is the NJ state insect.</p>
    <p>It makes honey for sweetening our meals and beeswax to smooth things out.</p>
    <p>Honeybees also pollinate our flowers, including the NJ state flower, the violet.</p>
    <p>Here are some interesting facts about honeybees:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Honeybees are incredibly important pollinators. They visit 50-100 flowers on a single foraging trip and can carry up to 35% of their body weight in pollen.</li>
<li>This pollination helps many plants, fruits, and vegetables reproduce and grow.</li>
<li>Honeybees have an advanced communication system. When a worker bee finds a good source of nectar, it performs a "waggle dance" to communicate the location, distance, and size of the food source to other bees in the hive.</li>
<li>This allows the hive to efficiently gather resources.</li>
<li>Honeybees never sleep - they take short breaks and periods of rest instead.</li>
<li>They have an internal GPS that allows them to find their way home from miles away, using the sun as a compass.</li>
<li>A single honeybee hive can contain 50,000-60,000 worker bees.</li>
<li>The queen bee is the only fertile female and her primary job is laying eggs. Worker bees can actually "fire" the queen if her egg-laying ability declines.</li>
<li>Honeybees produce honey in a variety of colors and flavors depending on the flowers they visit. </li>
<li>A single worker bee may fly up to 500 miles in its lifetime, visiting thousands of flowers.</li>
<li>Honeybees are the only insects that produce food for humans.</li>
<li>Honey is full of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and amino acids, and can be used as a natural energy boost and antimicrobial agent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, honeybees are fascinating, hardworking insects that play a crucial role in our ecosystem and food production. Protecting honeybees is important for the health of our planet.</p>
